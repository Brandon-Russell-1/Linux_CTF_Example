Hey Team,

Our dear friend "password123" has been working hard for far too long. It's been guarding accounts, fending off cyber invaders, and frankly, it's exhausted. We think it's time to give "password123" a well-deserved vacation (maybe to a beach with stronger security protocols).

So, let's show our appreciation by coming up with new, creative, and stronger passwords. Think of it as giving "password123" a gold watch and a hearty handshake for its years of service. And remember, a good password is like a strong cup of coffee â€“ it should be robust, keep you alert, and never easy to break!

Thanks for your cooperation,
The IT Admin Team
